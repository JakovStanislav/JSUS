# JSUS-Just a Simple UI for Seismologists

Just a Simple UI for Seismologists (JSUS) is a user interface that helps seismologists quickly inspect and visualize seismograph and accelerograph data. At the moment it is possible to read all formats that can be read using [ObsPy](https://docs.obspy.org/) package as well as files with the .v1 extension. In JSUS users can pick P and S earthquake phases and visualize the Fourier amplitude spectrum and spectrogram.

## Installing JSUS

Argos works with Python 3.7 and higher.

To run JSUS first clone repository:

    git clone https://github.com/JakovStanislav/JSUS
    
Then run the setup.py file:

    python setup.py install
    
Finally, run the main:

    python main.py
    
## Using JSUS
The JSUS main window consists of a table (left side) that contains information on all loaded records. On the right side of the main window, there are three figures, one for each of the record´s components. Above the figures, there is a navigation toolbar that is used for navigating through the data set. Also, on the right of the navigation toolbar, there are two fields that show the selected times of the **P** and **S** phases.
