JSUS-Just a Simple UI for Seismologists
==========

Just a Simple UI for Seismologists (JESUS) is a user interface that helps seismologists quickly inspect 
and visualize seismograph and accelerograph data. At the moment it is possible to read all formats that 
can be read using [ObsPy](https://docs.obspy.org/) package as well as files with the .v1 extension.
In JSUS users can pick P and S earthquake phases and visualize the Fourier amplitude spectrum and spectrogram.
